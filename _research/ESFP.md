excerpt: 'Leveraging a monocular RGB stream and a novel Transformer-based smoothing module (HPSTM), this end-to-end ESFP pipeline estimates 3D human pose via ROMP, enforces anatomical consistency through forward‑kinematics, and maps refined trajectories to a low‑cost 4‑DoF uArm in real time. By jointly predicting per‑joint uncertainty and applying dynamic filtering, it delivers smooth, reliable vision‑to‑robot imitation for desktop manipulation tasks.'
