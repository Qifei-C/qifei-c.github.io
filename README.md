## About Me

I am **Qifei Cui**, a candidate for the Master of Science in Engineering (M.S.E.) in **Systems Engineering** at the **University of Pennsylvania**, expecting to graduate in **June 2026**. I am passionate about developing intelligent systems that can perceive, understand, and interact with the world in sophisticated ways. My research interests lie at the intersection of **computer vision**, **Vision‑Language‑Action (VLA) models**, **robot control**, and **recommendation systems**.

Under the supervision of **Prof. Pratik Chaudhari**, I have worked on projects spanning humanoid robotics and medical image analysis. My goal is to contribute to autonomous agents that integrate visual understanding, language comprehension, and precise physical actions. In the realm of recommendation systems, I focus on the cold‑start problem and enhancing model adaptability.

## Recent Works

**Hybrid Visual‑Physical Humanoid Arm Control Strategy**:
  Architected a multi‑stage control pipeline beginning with visual pose estimation and integrating an advanced 3D human‑pose refinement module (**HPSTM**). HPSTM employs a Transformer‑based temporal encoder and a differentiable forward‑kinematics decoder to ensure kinematically valid inputs for high‑precision physical arm control. Introduced manifold‑constrained pose representations and pose‑covariance estimation for robust state fusion with physical models.

**Adversarial Learning for Brain Tumor Segmentation (GANet‑Seg)**:
  Designed **GANet‑Seg**, a hybrid framework combining GAN‑based anomaly detection with U‑Net segmentation. Achieved an **88.84 % Dice coefficient** on the BraTS dataset with only 300 training volumes—comparable to state‑of‑the‑art models trained on much larger datasets.

**Graph‑Based Embedding Sequential Recommendation System**:
  Tackled the cold‑start problem by augmenting **BERT4Rec** with dynamic graph layers and 20‑D user/item embeddings, improving recommendation accuracy by **4.21 %** and **Recall@10 by 5.38 %** for users with sparse histories.

## Experience

**Intern Data Analyst, Alphabet Inc.**
  Built scalable data‑preprocessing pipelines and engineered a double‑tower recommendation model, reaching **Recall\@10 = 78.2 %**. Developed new user‑item interaction embeddings, boosting benchmark accuracy by **2.3 %**.
