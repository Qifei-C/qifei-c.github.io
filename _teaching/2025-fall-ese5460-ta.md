I serves as a graduate TA for ESE 5460 Deep Learning Principle in Fall 2025.

### Office Hours

- **Time:** Tue 1:00-2:00 PM  
- **Location:** TBA

### Quick Policies

1. **One big question (or two short ones) per visit.**  
    Re-enter the queue if you need more time—this keeps things fair when deadlines loom.

2. **Come prepared.**  
    Before you hop into the queue, make sure you’ve done the checklist below.
    - Have your code running at the exact error or section.  
    - Write a short queue description (e.g., "HW1 Q3: training loss behaving oddly").  
    - Check Ed Discussion first; your answer might already be there.

3. **Share, don’t outsource.**  
    I’ll help you reason through problems, but won’t hand over finished code.

4. **Be kind.**  
    Everyone’s here to learn—patience and respect go a long way.

### Q&A Outside Office Hours

We’ll use **Ed Discussion** for async questions. Find it in Canvas under *"Ed Discussion"* on the left sidebar. Please search before posting to avoid duplicates.

*Looking forward to working with you—see you soon!*
