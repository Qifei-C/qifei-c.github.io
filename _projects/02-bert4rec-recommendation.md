An enhanced implementation of BERT4Rec that incorporates graph-based embeddings to improve sequential recommendation accuracy. This project addresses the cold-start problem by augmenting the original BERT4Rec architecture with dynamic graph layers.

## Key Features
- BERT-based sequential recommendation
- Graph-augmented embeddings
- Handles cold-start scenarios effectively
- Improved performance on sparse interaction data

## Technologies
- Transformers library
- PyTorch
- BERT architecture
- Sequential modeling techniques
