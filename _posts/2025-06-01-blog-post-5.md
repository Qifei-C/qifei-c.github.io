*Happy Pride Month! June is a time for celebration, reflection, and showing support for the LGBTQ+ community. As developers, we have a unique canvas for expression: our own websites. Adding a small touch of Pride to a personal site is a wonderful way to signal that it's a safe, inclusive space and to stand as an ally.*

### The First Idea: Adding a Flag Element

This year, I wanted to add a Pride element to my website's navigation bar. What started as a plan to add a simple flag element evolved into a much more elegant and integrated solution. I wrote this tutorial to share how I applied a pride flag gradient to a Font Awesome icon on my Jekyll site using the `lgbtq.css` library and a clever CSS trick.

### Step 1: Link the Required Stylesheets

First, we need to include two external CSS libraries in our website's `<head>`: **Font Awesome** for the icon itself, and **`lgbtq.css`** for the pride flag gradients. The easiest way is to use a CDN. Add the following lines to the `_includes/head/custom.html` file.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.5.0/css/all.min.css](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.5.0/css/all.min.css)">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[https://unpkg.com/lgbtq.css](https://unpkg.com/lgbtq.css)">
```

### Step 2: Define the Gradient Style

Next, create a CSS class that applies the gradient effect. Add the following code to our `_sass/_custom.scss` file.

```css
.rainbow-icon {
  /* Use a gradient variable from lgbtq.css (e.g., --gay, --rainbow) */
  background: var(--gay);

  /* Clip the background to the icon's shape */
  -webkit-background-clip: text;  /* For WebKit browsers (Chrome, Safari) */
  background-clip: text;          /* Standard property */

  /* Make the icon's color transparent to let the background show */
  -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent; /* For WebKit browsers */
  color: transparent;
}
```

### Step 3: Apply the Class to Our Icon

Finally, apply the `.rainbow-icon class` to the icon we want to style. In this example, I modify the Bionic Reading toggle icon in `_includes/masthead`.html.

```html
<li id="bionic-reading-toggle" class="masthead__menu-item persist tail bionic-toggle" title="Toggle Bionic Reading">
  <a>
    <i class="fa-solid fa-book-reader rainbow-icon" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</li>
```

And that's it! After saving our changes, the icon will now display the beautiful pride gradient. This simple but powerful technique is a great way to show your allyship.

Happy Pride!
