*If you're a dev working in robotics, you've probably wanted to check out Google DeepMind's MuJoCo MPC. It's a fantastic toolkit. But if you're on a Windows machine, you've probably also hit a wall trying to get it running. I know I did.*

### The Problem: VMs are Clunky, Old Dockers are Broken

My first instinct was to spin up a Linux VM. That was a dead end. It was slow, and trying to get GPU passthrough working correctly with the simulator's GUI was an absolute nightmare.

So, I turned to Docker. Seemed like the right tool for the job. But every guide and existing Dockerfile I found on the web felt obsolete. Most were built on old **CUDA 11.x** versions, required a bunch of manual tweaks, or just didn't play nice with a modern **WSL 2** setup on Windows. The goal is to do research, not spend a week debugging someone else's environment.

### The Solution: A Clean Build for CUDA 12

I was frustrated, so I decided to build the solution I wished I'd found in the first place. My goals were simple:
* Build on a recent **NVIDIA CUDA 12.2** image.
* Make it work seamlessly with Docker Desktop's **WSL 2 backend** for GPU support.
* Provide a straightforward way to get the GUI working on the Windows host.
* Script the entire thing in one `Dockerfile` for a reproducible build.

What I ended up with is a setup that just works. It combines the power of WSL 2 with a simple Windows X Server (**VcXsrv**) to give you a native-like experience. You can find the complete Dockerfile and all instructions in the (GitHub repository)[https://github.com/Qifei-C/MJPC-CUDA12]. Hope it helps you get straight to the fun part.

### The Nitty-Gritty: How it Works

The whole setup boils down to two key pieces of code.

#### 1. The `Dockerfile`: The Build Script
This is the recipe for the entire environment. It's responsible for layering everything we need on top of a clean NVIDIA base image.

It starts with a solid foundation: `nvidia/cuda:12.2.2-cudnn8-devel-ubuntu22.04`. From there, it uses `apt-get` to pull in all the C++ build essentials and X11 libraries (`libglfw3`, `libxrandr-dev`, etc.) and then uses `pip` to install the Python dependencies like `mujoco` and `gymnasium`. You don't have to install a single thing inside the container manually; it's all scripted.

```dockerfile
# CUDA-enabled MuJoCo 3.x (Python ≥ 3.10) – CUDA ≥ 12.2
ARG cuda_docker_tag="12.2.2-cudnn8-devel-ubuntu22.04"
FROM nvidia/cuda:${cuda_docker_tag}

ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive \
    PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \
    MUJOCO_GL=egl \
    LANG=C.UTF-8

# Install all system-level dependencies for C++ and Python
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        python3 python3-pip git build-essential \
        libosmesa6-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libglfw3 libglew-dev \
        libxrandr2 libxinerama1 libxcursor1 ...

# Install Python packages
RUN python -m pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir pip setuptools wheel && \
    pip install --no-cache-dir \
        "mujoco>=3.3" \
        glfw \
        gymnasium[robotics] \
    ...

# ... SSH and Entrypoint configuration
```

#### 2. The `docker run` command: The Key
Once the image is built, this one-liner is what brings it to life.

```bash
docker run --gpus all --env NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all -it --name mjpc_env -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0.0 -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix mujoco-py310 /bin/bash
```

Let's break down the important flags:
* `--gpus all`: The magic flag. This passes your host's NVIDIA GPU directly into the container.
* `-e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0.0`: This is the networking trick. It tells GUI applications inside the container to send their visuals to the display located at `host.docker.internal:0.0`, which is our VcXsrv instance running on Windows.
* `-v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix`: Mounts the necessary Unix socket for X11 forwarding to work.

### Get it Running
I've detailed everything in the `README`, but here's the tricks:
1.  **Prep your Windows host**: Make sure Docker Desktop (using the WSL 2 backend) and VcXsrv are installed and running. Critically, when you launch VcXsrv, you must **disable access control**.
2.  **Build the image**: `docker build -t mujoco-py310 .`
3.  **Launch the container**: Use the `docker run` command above.
4.  **Compile MJPC**: Inside the container, clone the `mujoco_mpc` repo, `mkdir build && cd build`, `cmake ..`, and `make -j"$(nproc)"`.
5.  **Test it**: Run `./bin/mjpc --task cartpole`. If everything is set up right, the simulation window will pop up on your Windows desktop.

I'm sharing this to hopefully save other developers the headache I went through. Environment setup is a tedious chore that gets in the way of the actual work. This repo is my attempt to script that chore away. Check out the `README` for the full walkthrough and troubleshooting. Hope it helps you get straight to the fun part.
