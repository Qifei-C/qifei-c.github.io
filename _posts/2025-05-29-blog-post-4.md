*Notes to My Future Self*

### Why I Even Asked

While reading yet another paper on preference-aligned fine-tuning, it hit me: we keep pushing LLMs and diffusion models toward “the right answer” or “human-preferred output,” but **can their outputs be organized into a real algebraic structure?**
If I define an operation—say, *compose*(text₁, text₂)—are the results closed? Could there be an associative “addition” or even an “inverse” that turns the space of generations into a **group, ring, or field**? It’s an intoxicating thought: import centuries of algebra straight into model interpretability.

### Immediate Reality Check

The daydream popped as soon as I tried to formalize it:

* **Black-box opacity** – I only see inputs and outputs; the internal mapping is a 100-billion-parameter fog.
* **No affine invariance** – Even basic geometric invariances are fragile. Expecting full algebraic closure is orders of magnitude harder.
* **Empirical hacks ≠ Theorems** – Current “manifold tricks” feel like patching a leaking ship, not discovering a pristine mathematical coastline.

### My Manifold-Training Detour

I spent weeks forcing a vision model to **“stay on a nicer manifold.”** Two stark outcomes:

1. **Big model, big headaches** – More parameters → gradient noise → violent oscillations.
2. **Small model, strange attractors** – Fewer parameters → it converges, but to what? The learned manifold looks like modern art; I can’t prove anything about its smoothness, let alone closure.

Half my sanity evaporated just getting *that* to work. The thought of elevating it to ring axioms feels absurd—at least right now.

### Theory vs. Engineering

|                | Theoretical dream                       | Practical reality                                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**       | Stable algebraic structure              | “Doesn’t explode” on training run                 |
| **Tools**      | Group axioms, topology, category theory | Adam W, learning-rate decay, countless restarts   |
| **Guarantees** | Closure, associativity, inverses        | Vague empirical “it usually works on the dev set” |

I adore the dream. But when each gradient step can throw the model off a cliff, the dream feels decades away.

### What I’m Taking Forward

1. **Keep the question alive** – Even if the answer is “not yet,” asking shapes better loss functions and priors.
2. **Focus on invariances first** – If I can’t nail affine invariance, a ring is fantasy.
3. **Respect the black box** – Interpretability methods may one day expose hidden structure, but today they mostly expose my GPU bill.
4. **Document the struggle** – Future-me will thank present-me for archiving both the romantic ideas *and* the bruises from chasing them.

### Closing Line to Myself

Until manifold training feels routine, I’ll treat “LLM outputs form a field” as a philosophical postcard—nice to look at, not yet a destination in my research itinerary.
