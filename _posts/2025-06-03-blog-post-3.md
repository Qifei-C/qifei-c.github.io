* **Deep, satisfying flavors**: Classic Korean comfort food, right at home.

Let’s get started!

### Ingredients

#### For the Sauce

* 105 ml soy sauce
* 100 ml corn syrup
* 1½ Asian pears (peeled, chopped)
* 1 apple (peeled, chopped)
* 2 tbsp Korean chili paste (gochujang)
* 10 ml sesame oil
* 3 tbsp Korean chili powder
* 22 cloves garlic
* 2 scallions
* 25 ml rum
* Salt & black pepper (about 5g pepper, adjust salt to taste)
* A splash of rice vinegar
* Pinch of dried celery (optional)
* Red food coloring (optional, for color boost)

#### For the Stew

* 1–1.5 kg beef short ribs
* ½ daikon radish (peeled, chopped, blanched)
* 2 carrots (peeled, chopped)
* 1 potato (peeled, chopped)
* 1 stick beef bone broth concentrate
* 1 leek or large scallion
* 50g kimchi
* Juice of half a lemon
* 4 scallions (to finish)
* Tteok (Korean rice cakes), optional
* Cheese, to finish

### Steps

**1. Make the Sauce**
Toss all sauce ingredients into a blender. Blend until completely smooth. Taste and adjust salt or spice if needed.

**2. Prep the Ribs**
Defrost the ribs, soak them in water for 30 minutes, then rinse thoroughly to remove any blood.
Pat dry. Sear the ribs in a hot, oiled pan until browned on all sides. Toss in a leek and fry until golden.

**3. Simmer the Base**
Move ribs (and leek) to a deep pot. Add water to just cover, plus the blanched daikon.
Bring to a boil, then simmer on medium for 10 minutes.
Stir in the beef bone broth concentrate.
Skim off any scum, then strain out any solids, keeping only ribs and broth.

**4. Flavor Boost**
Add the blended sauce, kimchi, lemon juice, salt, black pepper, and chopped scallions. Stir well.

**5. Bake to Perfection**

* Cover and bake at 350°F (175°C) for 1 hour.
* Uncover, raise heat to 420°F (215°C), bake another 30 minutes.
* Add the chopped carrots and potato, bake at 420°F for 20 minutes.
* Add tteok (if using), lower to 330°F (165°C), bake 10 minutes.

**6. Cheesy Finish**
Sprinkle cheese on top and use your oven’s grill/broil setting to melt and brown until golden.
