Recommender systems (RS) have seen rapid evolution in recent years, especially with the rise of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, most existing solutions still struggle with challenges such as data sparsity, cold start, and the long-tail effect. We introduce **GRPO-RS**—a novel architecture combining graph signal regularization and reinforcement learning for offline and scalable recommendation optimization.

## The Landscape: Existing Methods

### 1. KG-based RL for Recommendation

Typical methods like PGPR train agents to walk on a knowledge graph, regarding a successful path as a recommendation. These methods naturally provide interpretable recommendations, as each result is accompanied by a sequence of entity relations. Policy gradients are used for training.

### 2. Graph-Structured Agent-based Recommendation

Here, user-item interaction graphs are encoded (e.g., via GCNs) and the RL agent learns to select a set (slate) of items for recommendation. Open-source implementations like GNLR use DDPG (a variant of actor-critic) to optimize in the continuous action space—aimed at interactive and online recommendation, with a focus on solving data sparsity.

### 3. Multi-behavior/Session Graph Models

Session-based RL architectures (e.g., MB-GRL) build heterogeneous graphs from different user actions (click, cart, purchase), extracting transition patterns via graph attention networks. Reinforcement learning (often with DQN) is used to optimize rewards for each behavior, making these models suitable for high-value action prediction in multi-step settings.

### 4. RL-enhanced GNN Optimization

Some frameworks apply RL not to sequence recommendation, but to optimize the aggregation behavior of GNNs (e.g., DPAO). Agents learn when and how to aggregate higher-order neighbors, improving adaptivity and potentially boosting recall.

## Benefits of RL + GNNs

* **Rich State Representation:** GNNs naturally encode complex, structured states, providing strong input for RL agents.
* **Sequential Planning:** RL enables reasoning over long-term multi-step returns, moving beyond myopic (single-click) supervised learning.
* **Tackling the Long Tail:** RL's multi-round exploration can surface cold or novel items—addressing the long-tail problem.
* **Explainable Paths:** Paths found on graphs can be interpreted as reasoning chains for recommendations.

## Core Challenges

* **High Training Instability:** RL requires continuous interaction and trajectory sampling. Offline RL further suffers from off-policy bias and lack of negative signals.
* **Huge Action Space:** In graph-based settings, a node can have hundreds of outgoing edges—action pruning and reward shaping become essential.
* **Scalability:** Real-world RS graphs can contain millions of users and items, making direct RL optimization computationally expensive.
* **Generalization:** RL policies tuned for a dataset may not generalize to new distributions or item catalogs.

## Typical Datasets & Metrics

* **User-Item Interaction:** MovieLens, Amazon, Yelp, Pinterest (for classic offline benchmarks).
* **Knowledge Graphs:** Often merged with interaction data (e.g., MovieLens + IMDb/DBpedia).
* **Session Data:** Yoochoose, RetailRocket (for session-based and multi-round recommendation).

**Evaluation:**
Key metrics include Recall\@K, Precision\@K, Hit Ratio\@K, and NDCG\@K. Case studies may also be used to demonstrate unique strengths, such as interpretable knowledge paths.

## Motivation for GRPO-RS

GRPO-RS is inspired by several critical observations in RL-based recommendation:

* **Offline Policy Evaluation (OPE) is Inherently Counterfactual:** We must estimate new agent performance using logged data—prone to selection bias and data sparsity.
* **Variance Explosion:** Large action spaces and extreme IPS/DR weights (when the logging policy differs from the evaluation policy) make learning unstable, especially for rare/cold items.
* **Distributional Shift:** The learned policy may drift from the logging distribution, requiring explicit KL regularization and behavioral constraints.
* **Cold Start & Long Tail:** Pure IPS/DR-based training ignores unseen/cold items, exacerbating the long-tail problem.

## What Makes GRPO-RS Different?

1. **Inductive Bias via Graph Regularization:**
   The graph-based regularization (Rgraph) injects strong inductive bias, helping generalization under sparse data. It encourages the policy to be “smooth” over structurally similar nodes.

2. **Data Sharing:**
   By leveraging graph structure, knowledge is shared among similar users or items, mitigating sparsity.

3. **Extra Supervision:**
   Offline reward signals are fixed, but Rgraph provides an extra source of stable supervision, improving robustness and path quality.

## Architectural Highlights

* **Modular Decision Pipeline:**
  Two-stage architecture: (A) Pretrain embeddings using Graph-CL/BPR, (B) Freeze encoder and use GRPO for slate-level policy fine-tuning.
* **Groupwise Counterfactual Evaluation:**
  Counterfactual policy improvement is carried out within top-K candidate sets using in-group softmax, reducing IPS variance and supporting diversity-aware ranking.
* **Graph-aware Actor-Critic:**
  Combines GAT-Actor (meta-path regularization) with a graph-aware Critic for value estimation.
* **Offline Robustness:**
  Explicitly records propensities and performs bias/variance diagnostics (Weight-vs-Bias curves) for robust offline evaluation.

## Experimental Design & Ablations

Ablation studies are proposed to evaluate:

| Dimension                  | Variant         | Baseline         | Expected Effect                                  |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Listwise vs. Sequence-wise | Listwise-GRPO   | One-shot softmax | May hurt long-tail & diversity, faster inference |
| Meta-path Regularization   | Meta/Laplace    | Remove meta-path | Click-through for cold entities drops            |
| GAT Module                 | GAT             | Remove GAT       | Recall for cold entities drops                   |
| DR Weights                 | IPS             | No weights       | Wider confidence intervals                       |
| Critic Aggregation         | Subgraph Critic | Max-only         | Faster early convergence, lower final metrics    |

## Limitations and Open Questions

* **Advantage Calculation:**
  Current datasets only record pointwise feedback, limiting relative advantage computation. Future work may explore simulation environments or SoTA resampling techniques for groupwise evaluation.

* **Reward Bias:**
  Clicks, dwell time, and GMV are all susceptible to selection bias in offline evaluation. High-variance IPS/DR weights can destabilize training, especially for softmax-based policies.

* **Computation:**
  GRPO’s larger action sets and GNN integration increase both training and inference costs. Scalability for industrial-scale graphs remains an open issue.

## Conclusion

**GRPO-RS** is a promising attempt to marry graph-based regularization and RL for robust, explainable, and generalizable recommendation under offline and sparse data regimes. Its architecture modularity, inductive bias, and counterfactual evaluation set a new direction for research on graph-based RL in recommendation.
