## Work Experience

### Intern in Data Analytics @ Alphabet Inc.
*Mountain View, CA* Mar 2023 – Jun 2023

* Implemented efficient pipelines for preprocessing large datasets with 1m lines and ensured data integrity. Developed a double-tower recommendation model adapted from recent Recommendation System research papers with Recall@10 of 78.2%. Built real-world simulation with a node.js based App interface that generate movie suggestions with detailed information for registered user.
* Engineered new embeddings by analyzing user-item interaction data based on statistical distributions. Applied different levels to varying lengths of watching history, resulting in a 2.3% increase in benchmark accuracy. Achieved an accuracy of 79.3% on Recall10, demonstrating effective learning and robust generalization.


### Intern K-12 Teacher (Full-Time) @ United World College
*Changshu, China*  September 2021 – June 2022

* IB Mathematics: Analysis & Approaches SL (Grade 11). Planned and delivered inquiry-driven lessons, formative assessments, and exam-style tasks aligned with the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme objectives.
* Pre-IB Physics (Grade 10). Taught core mechanics, waves, and electricity units; designed hands-on laboratory activities and scaffolded problem-solving skills to prepare students for DP Physics.
* Analyzed student’s academic history and tailored instruction to address students’ neglected areas, with an outcome of average 40% improvement in simulated IB math exam scores.
* Supervised two student projects in Mathematics with finalized 5k+ words paper.
