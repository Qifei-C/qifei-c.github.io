I'm Qifeiâ€¯â€”â€¯a secondâ€‘year masterâ€™s student focusing on two interconnected areas:

1. Reinforcement Learning (RL) for safe, sampleâ€‘efficient decision making across sequential decision domains.
2. Geometric & Probabilistic Manifold Theory that yields mathematically explainable representations and preserves the intrinsic constraints of motion and multimodal sensor streams.

I pursue AI that understands the hidden geometries of motion and thought â€” bridging the physical and the abstract through mathematical insight.

## Core Research Lines

- **Humanoid Arm Motion via Manifoldâ€‘Constrained Models**
  Working with Prof.â€¯Pratikâ€¯Chaudhari, I transfer human upperâ€‘body motion to a 4â€‘DoF desktop arm.  My HPSTM Transformer learns boneâ€‘lengthâ€‘preserving manifolds that smooth 3â€‘D skeleton streams in real time, cutting teleâ€‘operation jitter by â‰ˆâ€¯38â€¯% and lowering endâ€‘effector MPJPE by â‰ˆâ€¯15â€¯% relative to classical Kalman and Savitzkyâ€‘Golay filters, all while guaranteeing physically plausible joint trajectories.

- **PRISM â€ƒ(Path Reasoning with Importance Samplingâ€¯&â€¯Multiâ€‘feedback â€” ongoing)**
  Parallel to my robotics work, I am designing PRISM, a bilevelâ€‘optimised framework that treats knowledgeâ€‘graph reasoning paths as RL actions and learns to sample them via importance weighting.  PRISM further incorporates heterogeneous user feedback to refine its path utility estimates, aiming for explainable, realâ€‘time recommendation without handâ€‘crafted rewards.  The project explores how the same RLâ€‘plusâ€‘manifold philosophy scales from physical embodiment to largeâ€‘scale decision systems.

## Background & Vision

I hold dual B.S. degrees in Applied Mathematics and Statistics & Data Science from UC Santaâ€¯Barbara.  This mathematical grounding supports my longâ€‘term goal: robots and decision systems that naturally understand, safely reason, and seamlessly collaborate with humans in messy, dynamic environments.
