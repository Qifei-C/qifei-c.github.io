I'm Qifei, a second-year master's student dedicated to developing intelligent systems that empower robots with robust perception, language comprehension, and precise physical actions. Under the supervision of *Prof. Pratik Chaudhari*, my research integrates Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and safe reinforcement learning methodologies to enhance humanoid arm control and assistive robotics. 

Before joining Penn, I obtained dual B.S. degrees in Applied Mathematics and Statistics & Data Science from UC Santa Barbara. This strong foundation in mathematical analysis and probabilistic modeling supports my ongoing research in embodied artificial intelligence and safe robot control.

My broader aim is to enable robots to naturally understand and effectively collaborate with humans in real-world scenarios, building **intelligent agents that see, think, and act**

## Research Interests
- Embodied Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models  
- Manifold-aware learning & optimized control 
- Graph-based recommender systems (cold-start, adaptability)
